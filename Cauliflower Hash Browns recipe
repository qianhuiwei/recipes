Recipe from tastemade.
All the flavor and goodness of a hash brown without any of the guilt!

//INGREDIENTS
1/2 head of cauliflower

1 egg

1/2 teaspoon yellow onion, minced

1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

1/8 teaspoon black pepper

1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon coconut oil or vegetable oil

Green onions, for garnish

//INSTRUCTIONS
Grate the cauliflower head on a cheese grater to create cauliflower shreds or "rice."

Combine the shredded cauliflower with egg, minced onion, salt, pepper and garlic powder; stir to combine.

Heat 1 teaspoon coconut oil over medium-high heat.

Add half the cauliflower mixture to the pan and gently press down with a spatula to flatten, working to keep the hash brown together as much as possible.

Cook for about 3-5 minutes. After the edges start to turn golden brown, cook for 1 minute.

Carefully flip over and cook an additional 3 to 4 minutes to let the edges brown and the cauliflower and onion cook through.

Garnish with chopped green onion.
